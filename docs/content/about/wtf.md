## Before cork

Other tools have tried to get something close to what cork can do but the
problem that we found is that many of those tools failed to solve problems
with the initial use of the tool. How do you properly communicate all
necessary dependencies when you're using a build tool. If we could make it
simpler by reducing the guess work immensely we could save users tons of time.
